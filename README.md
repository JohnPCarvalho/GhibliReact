### Ghibli React

This app is made with React.js, using styled-components to use CSS with the components.
I built this app to practice my react skills, and my inspiration was [Tania Rascia's](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-connect-to-an-api-with-javascript/) project.

This project has the implementation of some React core concepts, like components and state.
