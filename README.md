# Ghibli React

This app is made with [React.js,](https://reactjs.org/ "React.js,") using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/ "styled-components") to use CSS with the components. I built this app to practice my react skills, and my inspiration was [Tania Rascia's](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-connect-to-an-api-with-javascript/ "Tania Rascia's") project.

This project has the implementation of some React core concepts, like components and state.
